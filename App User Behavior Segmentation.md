    **App User Behavior Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning**



###### **Project Overview :**

Understanding user behavior is important for improving engagement, personalization, and business decisions in mobile applications. This project uses unsupervised machine learning to group users based on their behavior patterns. The objective is to identify distinct user segments that help businesses enhance marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase customer retention.



###### **Objectives :**



* Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering on user behavior data
* Apply clustering algorithms to identify user segments
* Analyze and interpret clusters for business insights
* Visualize user segments using dashboards
* Provide actionable recommendations based on segmentation results



###### **Methodology :**



* Data Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine Learning Model - Algorithm (K-Means Clustering)
* Optimal Cluster Selection - elbow method 



###### **Results \& Insights :**



* Clusters - Cluster 0,cluster 1 ,cluster 2,cluster 3
* User Type - C0-high user ,C1-moderate user,C2-low user ,C3-Occasional user
* Characteristics -C0-Frequent usage(high purchases) C1-Regular usage with moderate engagement,C2-Rare usage, short sessions,C3-High activity but low purchases.





###### **Visualization \& Dashboard - Streamlit to display :**



* Cluster distribution
* User behavior comparison
* Feature importance
* Segment insights
* Business recommendations



###### **Business Recommendations :**



* Target Cluster 3 with promotional offers to increase revenue
* Retention campaigns for Cluster 2 users
* Loyalty programs for Cluster 0 users
* Personalized notifications for Cluster 1 users

###### 

###### **Conclusion :**



This project successfully demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning can be used to understand user behavior patterns and generate actionable business insights. The segmentation approach enables companies to make data-driven decisions to improve engagement and revenue.
